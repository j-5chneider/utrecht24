Research data centers offer form fields tailored to the discipline or data type. With repositories use alternative possibilities, such as keyword fields.\n\ne.g., which variables does the quantitative data set contain?\ne.g., which topics does your data cover?\ne.g., which population did you draw your sample from?\n\n\n\n\nThe problem:\nJust because others find our data doesn’t mean the access barriers are as low as possible and doesn’t mean they know in which way they are allowed to access it. Examples:\n\nProviding a link to the data in the text of a paywalled journal article\nUnclear licensing / use conditions when providing data (e.g., are non-researchers allowed to access the data or is it only open for qualified researchers?)\n\nThe solutions:\n\nMake sure access is free of charge (or as cheap as possible)\n\ne.g., by providing link to data in publicly accessible sections of journal articles that are not open access\ne.g., by using repositories or research data centers that allow access free of charge\n\nMake sure users know if they can access and under which conditions\n\ne.g., research data centers ensure that terms of use are clear (who may access under what conditions) and offer different levels of access restriction\ne.g., on repositories provide a readme-file and an open license (e.g., CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA) with data sets for access cases\n\n\n\n\nThe problem:\nJust because others downloaded our data doesn’t mean they can open and manipulate it.\nThe solutions:\n\nUse file formats with open licenses\n\ne.g., tabular data: CSV (with additional labelling script), RData\ne.g., text data: PDF, HTML, ODT, RTF\n\nMake sure users know how different files are related to one another\n\ne.g., define which file contains student data and which teacher data\ne.g., define which file contains data from cohort 1 and which cohort 2, …\n\n\n\n\nThe problem:\nJust because others opened our data doesn’t mean they understand the data and its use-conditions. Examples:\n\nOthers can’t understand what the column names of the tabular data set mean: Which columns in the data set relate to which variables in the journal article?\nCan someone from sociology use the data set from psychology they found on osf.io?\nDoes someone reusing a data set have to cite the authors?\n\nThe solutions:\n\nAdhere to standards in folder organization\n\ne.g., PSYCH-DS (see technical specification draft)\n\nRich description/explanation of what user will find in the data set (≠ meta descriptions about the data set as a whole, as for accessibility)\n\ne.g., provide a codebook. How to semi-automatically create a codebook, see the R package codebook\n\nProvide a license for the use-cases\n\nagain, research data centers ensure that terms of use are clear (who may use under what conditions)\nagain, on repositories provide a readme-file and an open license (e.g., CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA) with data sets for the use-cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(FAIR principles and the role of scientists: Kraft, 2023)\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to be answered at the end?\nPlease put them here!\n\n\nKraft, A.

Such as simultaneous measures on gender, age, the combination of subjects studied, study location, and the place of birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndirect identifier\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, the existence of one indirect identifier in the data set does not constitute personal data. You have to judge for yourself at what point information/variables can be combined to identify a person. But in the end it comes down to: Better be save than sorry.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you collected personal data, the GDPR applies, and you’ll need the consent of the subjects to share the data (see next section). However, the GDPR does not apply to anonymous data and it can generally be shared without the need to obtain explicit consent for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute anonymity:\nData are modified by coarsening or removing variables (direct or indirect identifiers) to such an extent that identifying individual participants becomes impossible.\n\nFactual anonymity:\nDeanonymisation cannot be ruled out completely but the allocation of data to the respective statistical unit is only possible with an unreasonable effort in terms of time, cost and human resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymizing interview transcripts is feasible.

    "text": "16.2 Does my informed consent allow data sharing?\n\nRequirementsBroad consentBut wait…Task\n\n\nThe GDPR, only applies to personal data. This might mean that only with personal data you are obliged to obtain consent from your participants to share the data.\n\n\n\nBesides the usual requirements (voluntary participation, possibility of revocation, …), the informed consent requires the following aspects in order to be able to share data:\n\na statement that the data is being shared\na statement of whom the data will be shared with\na description of the purposes for which the data are used and reused\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPossibility of revocation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe possibility of revocation is only required as long as the data is not anonymous (i.e. personal). After anonymization, it is no longer possible to trace which data belongs to a particular person and it can therefore not be deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, we are not all-knowing. This includes the fact that we don’t know what others will do with the data we share. So what should we write as descriptions for the purposes?\n\n\n\n\nExample: Consent tailored for project\n“The data is processed and analysed for the purpose of investigating the correlations between learning strategies and learning success during studies. After completion of the project, the data will be made available to other researchers via an accredited research data center.”\n\nExamples: Broad consent\n“The data is processed and analysed for research purposes. After completion of the project, the data will be made available to other researchers via an accredited research data center.”\n“I give permission for the data that I provide to be deposited in an accredited research data center, so it can be used for future research and learning.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood resources\n\n\n\n\n\n🇺🇸 Recommendations of ICPSR\n🇬🇧 Information, samples and model forms of UK Data Service\n🇩🇪 Information, samples and model forms of VerbundFDB\n🇳🇱 Very good overview with Dos and Don’ts of the University of Utrecht\n🇪🇺 Maintaining privacy with open data (Video of presentation by Felix Schönbrodt)\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant as an assessment criterion is the respondent’s capacity for understanding what s/he is consenting to. If the participant doesn’t know future uses of the data, can we really speak of an informed consent? Maybe the direction of future analyses go against the participant’s will.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhom and how do we ask?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome studies suggest that participants rarely read the information or consent form carefully (Parfenova et al., 2024; Pedersen et al., 2011)\nSome studies suggest that very easy language may be better for understanding (and thus being informed) than “standard” language (Geier et al., 2021)\nThe minimum age differs between EU countries, can go down to 13 years (Germany: 16, Austria: 15)\nWith studies involving pupils in schools, additional regulations may come into effect that require parental consent.\n\n\n\n\nThese are challenging questions that need to be evaluated for every research project separately and can lead to some researchers deciding not to share the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\n\nCheck your informed consent: Did you mention that data is being shared? Does the purpose mentioned allow other researchers to reuse the data (e.g. for meta-analyses, reproducibility-checks)?\nDid you include any sentences similar to these, that hamper data sharing?\n\n“The data will only be used by members of the project group.”\n“The data will be deleted after termination of the project / after 5 years.”",

Even within a study, it may be necessary to restrict access to the data to varying degrees.\nE.g. if you are working with a (factually) anonymized quantitative data set and interview scripts that you have been asked to share only with researchers.\n\n\n\nRestrictions (or selective sharing) may be relevant due to…\n\ndata type: videos of people always count as personal data and might be shared only for research purposes\ndata type: interviews are usually tough to anonymize and anonymization process might decrease analysis potential\nSensitive data or data of vulnerable groups should be particularly protected against unlawful dual use\nStudent data and data of minors is generally considered to be in need of protection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith repositories…\n\n\n\n\n\nsharing levels are usually limited to\n\npublic (everybody sees everything)\nprivate (only you and your collaborators see everything)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith research data centers…\n\n\n\n\n\nthere are different sharing levels possible for different files (in the same project).

You have not received consent to share the interview data, but would like to store it securely.\n\nCheck osf.io to see if you can create a project where you can make your quantitative data publicly available and restrict access to your interview transscript so that only your research team can access it.\nCheck zenodo.org if you can create a repository to share your quantitative data publicly, create another repository to store your interview data with restricted access and the link the two repositories defining their relationship.\n\nIs there a research data center, where you would share data that needs restriction? Such as when you obtained consent to share the data, but only for research purposes.\n\nCheck the website of the research data center and try to find out what their sharing/restriction levels are\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeier, C., Adams, R.
